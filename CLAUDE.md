## Architecture Overview

This Discord music bot uses a microservices architecture with four main services:

### Services
- **Gateway** (`gateway/`) - Discord.js interface, handles slash commands and user interactions
- **Audio** (`audio/`) - Lavalink integration, music playback logic, and autoplay system  
- **API** (`api/`) - Express.js REST endpoints for external access and health checks
- **Worker** (`worker/`) - Background task processing (minimal implementation)

### Shared Packages (`packages/`)
- **@discord-bot/config** - Environment configuration with Zod validation
- **@discord-bot/database** - Prisma ORM, database models, and migrations
- **@discord-bot/logger** - Centralized Pino logging with Sentry integration
- **@discord-bot/commands** - Unified command system with decorators and middleware

### Communication
- **Redis pub/sub** - Primary inter-service communication via channels:
  - `discord-bot:commands` - Gateway ‚Üí Audio command routing
  - `discord-bot:to-audio` - Gateway ‚Üí Audio Discord events & **raw voice events** (Critical Fix: September 24, 2025)
  - `discord-bot:to-discord` - Audio ‚Üí Gateway Lavalink events
  - `discord-bot:ui:now` - Audio ‚Üí Gateway real-time UI updates
- **PostgreSQL** - Persistent storage for queues, settings, and feature flags
- **Lavalink** - External audio processing server

### Critical Voice Connection Fix (September 24, 2025)
**Raw Discord Events Handler**: Gateway now forwards `VOICE_SERVER_UPDATE` and `VOICE_STATE_UPDATE` events to Audio service, enabling `player.connected = true` and functional audio playback. This resolves the race condition that prevented voice connection establishment.

## Key Technologies
- **TypeScript + Node.js** with ES modules
- **pnpm workspaces** for monorepo management
- **Discord.js v14** for Discord API integration
- **Lavalink v4.1.1** for audio streaming with advanced plugins:
  - **YouTube Plugin v1.13.5** - Multi-client YouTube support (MUSIC, ANDROID_VR, WEB, WEB_EMBEDDED)
  - **SponsorBlock Plugin** - Automatic sponsor segment skipping for long sets
  - **LavaSrc Plugin v4.8.1** - Multi-platform support (Spotify, YouTube Music)
  - **LavaSearch Plugin v1.0.0** - Advanced search capabilities
- **lavalink-client v2.5.9** - Unified across all services (Critical Update: September 24, 2025)
- **Prisma** for database ORM
- **Vitest** for testing
- **OpenTelemetry** for observability
- **Sentry** for error monitoring and performance tracking

## Testing

Tests use Vitest with workspace package aliasing configured in `vitest.config.ts`. When adding new workspace packages that are imported in tested code, add their alias to avoid CI failures:

```typescript
alias: {
  '@discord-bot/database': path.resolve(__dirname, 'packages/database/src/index.ts'),
  '@discord-bot/logger': path.resolve(__dirname, 'packages/logger/src/index.ts'),
  '@discord-bot/config': path.resolve(__dirname, 'packages/config/src/index.ts'),
}
```

## Development Patterns

### Service Communication
Services communicate asynchronously via Redis pub/sub. Commands flow from Gateway to Audio, while UI updates flow back from Audio to Gateway.

### Error Handling
All services implement graceful shutdown, health checks, and structured error logging. Error monitoring is integrated across all services using Sentry for production-grade observability. Use the shared logger package for consistent log formatting and automatic error tracking.

#### Interaction Management
- **Processing Messages**: Immediate ephemeral "üéµ Processing..." responses prevent Discord timeout errors
- **Message Cleanup**: Automatic deletion of processing messages when UI is ready
- **Fallback Strategies**: Automatic fallback to new messages when edits fail
- **Command Context**: Audio service receives command type (`play`, `playnext`, `playnow`) for differential behavior
- **Voice Connection Persistence**: UI message deletion no longer triggers voice disconnection, preventing progressive delays

#### Discord API Error Resilience
- **Robust Error Classification**: Automatic detection of retryable vs non-retryable Discord API errors
- **Smart Retry Logic**: Exponential backoff for rate limits (code 20028), immediate fallback for non-retryable errors (10008, 50001, etc.)
- **Automatic Fallbacks**: Failed message edits automatically create new messages with cleanup of old ones
- **UI Message Management**: Single UI message per channel with automatic cleanup
- **Interaction Timeout Prevention**: Immediate ephemeral responses prevent "application did not respond" errors
- **Error Metrics**: Comprehensive Prometheus metrics for Discord operation monitoring:
  - `discord_api_errors_total` - Errors by operation, code, and retryable status
  - `discord_operation_retries_total` - Retry attempts by operation
  - `discord_operation_duration_seconds_total` - Operation timing and success rates
- **Transparent Recovery**: Message update failures are handled silently with fallback strategies

### Performance Optimizations
- Search results cached for 5 minutes
- Search throttling prevents API abuse  
- Batch queue updates to reduce database load
- Memory monitoring for garbage collection
- **Lavalink optimizations**: High-quality opus encoding (quality: 10), advanced resampling, optimized buffer settings
- **YouTube bypass**: Multiple client configurations for maximum compatibility

### Autoplay System
The bot features an advanced autoplay system with multiple recommendation modes:

- **Similar** (default) - Tracks similar to currently playing song
- **Artist** - More tracks from the same artist
- **Genre** - Tracks from detected genre (house, techno, trance, etc.)
- **Mixed** - Combination of artist (40%), genre (40%), and similar (20%) tracks

#### Electronic Music Support
- **Remix Support**: Allows official remixes while filtering low-quality content
- **Genre Detection**: Automatically detects electronic music genres from track titles/artists
- **Quality Filtering**: Advanced blacklist system blocks aggregator channels and low-quality content

### UI Controls & Command Behavior
The Discord interface features an organized 3-row button layout:

**Row 1**: ‚èØÔ∏è Play/Pause | ‚è™ -10s | ‚è© +10s | ‚è≠Ô∏è Skip
**Row 2**: üîä Vol + | üîâ Vol - | üîÅ Loop | ‚èπÔ∏è Stop
**Row 3**: üîÄ Shuffle | üóíÔ∏è Queue | üßπ Clear | ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Autoplay

#### Music Command Behavior
- **`/play`**:
  - No music playing: Creates channel UI message with track info
  - Music playing: Sends ephemeral "Track Queued" message, maintains existing UI
- **`/playnext`**:
  - No music playing: Creates channel UI message (behaves like `/play`)
  - Music playing: Sends ephemeral "Track Queued" message, adds track to front of queue
- **`/playnow`**:
  - Immediately plays track without sending "Track Queued" notifications
  - Updates existing UI or creates new one if none exists
- **Queue Display**: Excludes currently playing track, shows only upcoming tracks
- **UI Management**: Single UI message per channel with automatic cleanup

### Configuration
Environment variables are validated through `@discord-bot/config` using Zod schemas. Check existing config schemas before adding new environment variables.

#### Lavalink Configuration
The bot uses an optimized Lavalink configuration (`lavalink/application.yml`) with:
- **High-quality audio**: 10/10 opus encoding, HIGH resampling
- **Performance tuning**: 400ms buffer, 5s frame buffer, seek ghosting enabled
- **Multiple YouTube clients**: Ensures maximum compatibility and bypass capabilities
- **SponsorBlock integration**: Automatically skips sponsor segments in long DJ sets
